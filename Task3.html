    <p>In the context of this discussion, one might say: <strong>//this is paragraph</strong> </p>
    
    <blockquote>" To keep your balance, you must keep moving."<strong>//this is quoted text</strong></blockquote>
   
    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <cite>Albert Einstein</cite>. <strong>//this is a citation tag.</strong></p>
    
    <p>In literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly. For example, if you're referencing a famous work like <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite> <strong> //this is a citation tag.</strong> </p>
    
    <p>  by Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper credit. Another classic example can be seen in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite><strong>//this is a citation tag.</strong> </p>
